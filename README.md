### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**edisondotme/edisondotme** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on editing this README.md
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ethics
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on decentralized technology
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with docker
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ethics of technology
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: see edison.me/contact
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I refuse to dignify this question with an answer
- âš¡ Fun fact: Corriander is the same thing as cilantro?
